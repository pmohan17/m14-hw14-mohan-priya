    <div class="col-sm-8 my-5">My name is Priya Mohan, and I was raised in Spring Hill, Florida. I graduated from the University of Florida in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Public Relations and a Minor in Theatre. I currently live in Detroit with my two cats. I work in marketing for an arts nonprofit in Detroit, which helps small to mid-sized arts organizations in the city present arts events. I do side work for a market research firm in Detroit and work with clients like the Michigan Department of Education and Pulte Homes. One thing I'm looking forward to next year is solo backpacking in Thailand. </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 my-5"><b>Fun fact:</b> <i>While most people don't know where Spring Hill is, many people visit its close neighbor Weeki Wachee, which is known for its live mermaid shows. People are always surprised when I say I have friends who became mermaids after high school.</i> </div>

  I honestly have no clue. I'm hoping to find a career where I am consistently challenged with my work, able to continue to learn, while still having a healthy work-life balance to explore by hobbies and interests.
